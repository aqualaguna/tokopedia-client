# Nodejs Tokopedia Open Api Client

this project started as my goal to use tokopedia api easily. this project has not fully tested yet. but basic functions still function perfectly.

for more use case please refer to test file.


Wrote Using Typescript and Type Definition for request and response.
Fully well documented and modulated.

## Usage
```
npm install tokopedia-client
```

## Basic Usage
```
let client = new TokopediaClient({
  fs_id: 'YOUR FS ID',
  client_id: 'YOUR CLIENT ID',
  client_secret: 'YOUR CLIENT SECRET'
})
await client.authenticate();
let result = await client.product.getProductInfo(undefined, [
  'https://www.tokopedia.com/shop-api9/testing-flash-sale-1'
]);
console.log(response);
```

There is 8 modules :
- Chat (chat)
- Logistic (logistic)
- Order (order)
- Product (product)
- Shop (shop)
- Statisic  (statistic)
- Webhook (webhook)
- Multi Origin  => for now this is not implemented (not production ready)

The left is the module name the right side is the name in client object.
for example Shop module is called this way :
```
client.shop.getShopInfo(57656372);
```
